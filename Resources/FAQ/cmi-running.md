This page should help explain what I personally think is the way to run CMI on Spigot-, and Paper 1.19.

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Note ahead.

The latest version of CMILib is required. Zrips' libraries and other resources are linked below.

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> 1.19.x

- Is there a build for 1.19.4? Yes, CMI 9.5.x.x can be used on 1.19.4.
- Will there be a build for 1.20? Future versions are likely to get an update, yes.
- Do I need to buy a new license to upgrade? No.
- Can I upgrade from an older version of CMI to the build for 1.19.x? Yes, latest CMI and CMILib jars will achieve this.
- CMILib will be required? Yes. CMILib 1.2.5.x or newer is required for 1.19.4
- So where do I download it? spigotmc.org (link below)

### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Backup

- First, I strongly recommend before making any changes to your live server to take it offline with `/stop` and **make a complete backup** of the full directory, do not forget to backup your MySQL databases if you use any. 

### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Test setup

- Before you actually update your live server it's recommended to have a test instance you can try stuff out on. This way you can detect issues and concerns early and learn to address those.

### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Before we start to install and/or upgrade CMI 9

- `/stop` your server. Do the backup thing, and make a test server.

- Go to SpigotMC and buy CMI if you haven't yet. And use BuildTools.jar from SpigotMC to build the latest version of Spigot 1.19.x or download Paper 1.19.x from their site, and get the latest release of CMI 9, here is the link: <https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/3742/>
<img width="512" alt="cmi-download-jar-from-spigot-01" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28841349/172343317-4cad8fac-451e-40ef-a6e1-143a6c850ef0.png">

- If you are not yet running CMILib then it will automatically download it. If this isn't the case due to firewalls or whatever reason, you can also manually download it here: <https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/87610/>

- Now that we have the latest files and are installing or upgrading from an older version to a new version, and we have a backup. It's time to replace any existing jars.

### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> First time Installalation

_If you already are running CMI, you can skip this and go straight to Upgrading (see below)._

- Put the downloaded CMI `.jar` in the `~/plugins/` directory. 

- Put the downloaded CMILib `.jar` in the `~/plugins/` directory as well.

- Start the server and let it complete loading.

- Keep an eye on the console, the `latest.log` will also have all the details. If something goes wrong, take note. And try to figure out what is up and try again. 

- If you spot any bugs, confirm them, and report them to Zrip's Github as a new issue.

- When the server has started, CMI will automatically download languages, CMILib and you're ready to proceed to the **Finish** step (below).

### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Upgrading CMI

_If you are installing it for the first time, go to the Installing steps above and skip the upgrading steps._

- Keep the existing `plugins/CMI/` folder, do not delete it.

- Keep the existing `plugins/CMILib/` folder, do not delete it.

- If you don't have the CMILib folder, don't worry, CMI will create it for you.

- If you have the old CMILib version, don't worry, CMI will auto-upgrade it, and we will clean up after.

- Remove the old CMI `.jar` you're using from the plugins/ directory. 

- Put the freshly downloaded CMI `.jar` in the plugins/ directory. 

- Put the freshly downloaded CMILib `.jar` in the plugins/ directory as well.

- Start the server and let it complete loading.

- Keep an eye on the console, the `latest.log` will also have all the details. If something goes wrong, take note. And try to figure out what is up and try again.

- When the server has started, CMI will automatically download languages, CMILib and you're ready to proceed to the **Finish** step (below).

- If your plugins/ directory has the old CMILib `.jar` files, it is okay to remove them now. Keep the new .jar of course.

### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Finishing up.

Okay, you've backed everything up, you've made a test setup, and you've either fresh installed or upgraded CMI. Just one more thing before you can play with this test setup that is now running.

- This test setup has to `/stop` and restart once. This way any new languages, converted data, and updated libraries can be put to use.

- And now you can start it again. Keep an eye on the console (or `latest.log`) again and make sure there's no weird errors.

And that's it! You're done.

What a list huh, okay, now you have experience, you have tested, and you can do it again: but on the live server! Have fun with CMI.

#### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> What about 1.16.5?

CMI will not run on 1.16.0 or 1.16.1, but 1.16.5 is supported. You can use the latest cmi and CMILib jars on 1.16.5. I always recommend to stay current for each family branch.

The same goes for other older versions, use the latest build for the branch you're using, so not 1.8.0, but 1.8.8, so not 1.12.0 but 1.12.2. 

#### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Resources
